The little Love-god lying once asleep
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
And so the general of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,
  Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
  Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.

小小爱神有一次呼呼地睡着，
把点燃心焰的火炬放在一边，
一群蹁跹的贞洁的仙女恰巧
走过；其中最美的一个天仙
用她处女的手把那曾经烧红
万千颗赤心的火炬偷偷拿走，
于是这玩火小法师在酣睡中
便缴械给那贞女的纤纤素手。
她把火炬往附近冷泉里一浸，
泉水被爱神的烈火烧得沸腾，
变成了温泉，能消除人间百病；
但我呵，被我情妇播弄得头疼，
　　跑去温泉就医，才把这点弄清：
　　爱烧热泉水，泉水冷不了爱情。
